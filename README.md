Additive Manufacturing in itself has been proved to be a more sustainable mean of production, capable of reduce emissions and material waste. The large pool of 3Ding process present, along with their relative materials, can be easily integrate into the design phases thanks to Computer Design strategies. Leveraging on GH as its main environment to design, an Interactive Generative Modeling (IGM) tool was developed integrating various way to reach the target. First, it was necessary to investigate practical strategies to customize or apply texture and pattern on any type of 3D shape.
