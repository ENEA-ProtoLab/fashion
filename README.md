Additive Manufacturing in itself has been proved to be a more sustainable mean of production, capable of reduce emissions and material waste. The large pool of 3Ding process present, along with their relative materials, can be easily integrate into the design phases thanks to Computer Design strategies. Leveraging on GH as its main environment to design, an Interactive Generative Modeling (IGM) tool was developed integrating various way to reach the target. First, it was necessary to investigate practical strategies to customize or apply texture and pattern on any type of 3D shape. These experiments also proved to be a good way to showcase the potentiality of the tool and promote collaborations with CCI and SME. Most importantly, it provides an opportunity to easy access the latest technologies available and helps drive sustainable practices and models in the Fashion sector.
Three case studies were conducted based on the target to establish possible best practices for applying IGM. For the Jewelry sector, thanks to the Spin-Off ENEA Logis3D S.R.L., which develops specialized software for the sector and boasts links with Trade Associations, several companies inside and outside the region were contacted.
